	<h1>BLACK LANDSCAPES MATTER</h1>
	<body>
	<p>The BlackLivesMatter Movement is the call for justice of the historically silenced voices of the black community. The movement is more than protests, it is a space of inclusion, a community of resilience and a raging hope for civil liberties. The BlackLandscapesMatter is a project that focuses on the importance of space, identity and visibility the black community has in America. This collection maps aims to be telling of the disparities and injustices of the black community in order to educate those about the history and reality of black community.

		This map visualises the different flows that children of privilege and an unfathomable amount of children fromthe black community take throughout their childhood. The white flow is straight forward and a clear path to a future, while the grey flow is recursive througout the criminal justice system with ambiguiutues about what will happen next.
